Hi there, I'm Ryan, a software engineer and researcher with a passion for building scalable, robust systems that bridge cloud infrastructure, AI/ML, and human-centric design. Currently, I am working on my PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I specialize in optimizing cloud applications, designing distributed systems, and solving complex technical challenges through data-driven, innovative software solutions.

In recent years, I have contributed to cutting-edge projects at organizations like IBMâ€™s Centre for Advanced Studies, where I pioneered Java performance improvements in cloud environments. Nonetheless, my expertise spans full-stack development, game development, and AI-driven systems, with a knack for turning theoretical concepts into practical tools.

Beyond technical execution, I thrive on collaboration and mentorship. In the past, I have developed hands-on labs for award-winning courses, led Agile teams to deliver impactful products, and mentored peers to elevate collective problem-solving. When I am not coding or doing research, you can find me hiking, reading, playing board games, hitting the slopes, or playing/watching hockey.
